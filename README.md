### 👋 Hi, I’m Arnav

I’m exploring **AI systems development**, with a current focus on **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), AI agents, and evaluation of LLM-based systems**.

Right now, I’m learning by **building small, runnable systems** and publishing them openly — starting from minimal baselines and gradually adding complexity. My goal is to understand *how these systems actually behave*, where they fail, and what design choices matter in practice.

I’m especially interested in:
- RAG systems and retrieval quality
- Agent design (planning, tools, memory)
- Evaluation, observability, and failure modes
- Turning research ideas into working code

Most repositories here are **experiments, baselines, or learning artifacts**, not production frameworks. They are designed to be simple, inspectable, and honest about limitations.

I’m documenting this journey publicly to build depth over time and to make my learning reusable for others.
